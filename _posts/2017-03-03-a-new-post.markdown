The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[1] As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility.[2][3] The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice. The MIT license is also compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL); MIT licensed software can be integrated into GPL software, but not the other way around.[4]

As of 2015, it is the most popular software license, ahead of any GPL variant and other Free and open-source software (FOSS) licenses.[5][better source needed][6][better source needed][7][not in citation given] Notable projects that use one of the versions of the MIT License include Ruby on Rails, Node.js, jQuery, and the X Window System.
